# Project Goal and Requirements

## Project Overview & Objective
- Develop a comprehensive machine learning project using a real-world dataset (UCI Credit Card Default or similar).
- Address a meaningful, practical problem with clear business or research value.

## Dataset Requirements
- Use a real-world dataset (not toy data).
- Dataset must be approved or justified in the context of the project.
- Provide a clear description and rationale for dataset selection.

## Topics Coverage
- Cover at least 10 topics from Weeks 1–12 of the course, such as:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Gradient Descent / SGD
  - Kernel Methods / SVM
  - Regularization
  - Cross-Validation
  - Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Learning Curves
  - Evaluation Metrics
  - Ensemble Methods
  - Model Comparison

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb):**
  - Well-documented, monolithic notebook covering all project phases
  - Includes code, analysis, visualizations, and discussion
- **PowerPoint Slides:**
  - 10–15 slides summarizing the project, results, and key insights
- **Project Summary Report:**
  - 2–3 pages (Word or PDF) summarizing the project, findings, and conclusions
- **Video Presentation:**
  - 5–10 minute video presenting the project and results

## Collaboration & Division of Work
- Team-based project (3 members recommended)
- Clear division of work and documentation of each member’s contributions
- Assignments:
  - Member 1: Data acquisition, EDA, preprocessing
  - Member 2: Feature engineering, modeling, training
  - Member 3: Evaluation, results analysis, deliverables

## Reproducibility & Submission Guidelines
- Include `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages
- Provide clear setup and execution instructions
- Submit all deliverables by the deadline in specified formats

## Academic Integrity & Citations
- All work must be original and properly cited
- Ensure Turnitin compliance
- Include references and appendix as needed
## Member Checkpoint Requirement
- Each team member must contribute to a distinct section of the notebook.
- Contributions should be clearly marked with markdown headers indicating the responsible member.
- Regular checkpoints and reviews will be conducted to validate individual contributions before merging into the final notebook.
- This ensures transparency, accountability, and fair assessment of each member's work.
